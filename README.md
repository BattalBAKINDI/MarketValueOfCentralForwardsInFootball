# Market Value Of Central Forwards In Football

## The Goal Of The Project
- Although some football teams have high xG (goal expectation) statistics during the season, they have trouble finding goals, so they decide to buy a central striker during the transfer season to solve the problem. But they want to buy at the best price. Our machine learning model, which we have trained from the data of 716 central strikers, will help the teams that apply to us in this regard.
- According to statistics, a team has an average of 3 central strikers. Based on this, we can think that our data includes approximately 238 teams and since there are 20 football teams in each league on average, we get the data from 12 different leagues. these statistics show that we are working on enough data for us.
